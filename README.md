# Project Name: Board Game AI

## Overview
The "Board Game AI" project is a simulation of a strategic two-player board game with an integrated AI opponent. This AI, which employs the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, deftly analyzes potential moves to optimize gameplay success. The entire application is hosted via a Flask-based API, allowing for robust interaction and versatile deployment options, including Docker.

### Features
- **AI Move Prediction**: Utilizes Minimax with alpha-beta pruning for intelligent move analysis.
- **User Interactivity**: Player can customize gameplay setup via input files.
- **Web-based API**: Flask framework enables interactive board management and move prediction through HTTP requests.
